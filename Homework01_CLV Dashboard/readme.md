**Customer Lifetime Value**

Customer lifetime value (CLV, LTV) is a metric that businesses use to predict how much revenue a customer will drive over time

**CLV Calculation**

CLV = (Average Purchase Value - Average Purchase Frequency) x Average Customer Lifespan

- Average Purchase Value = Total Revenue/ Number of purchase
- Average Purchase Frequency = Number of purchase/Unique Customers
- Average customer lifespan = Customer lifespan/ Number of customers used in equation

**Simple calculation related to CLV also includes**

CLV = T x AOV x AGM x ALT/ number of clients for the period

- T is the average number of transactions per month
- AOV (Ticket size) is the Average order value
- AGM is the Average gross margin
- ALT is the Average customer’s lifespan in months 
- ALT = 1/churn rate%
  -> churn rate = (CB - CE/CB) x 100;
     Which CB is clients at the beginning of a month 
     and CE is client at the end of a month

- APRU = TR/CQ ; 
  TR is total revenue for a chosen period and 
  CQ is the number of customers for a chosen period
